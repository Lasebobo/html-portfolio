        <h3>Death Note</h3>
        <p>Very nice anime. Nice plot, and the twists and turn made it nice.</p>
        <h3>Invincibe</h3>
        <p>Currently on the second season. Really cool and bloody :).</p>
        <h3>X-men '96</h3>
        <p>Just watched two episodes. Not bad at all so far.</p>
        <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
        <p>Very nice anime too. I actually like the fact that they have some powers.</p>
        <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
        <p>The best anime I've watched. No competition. I can't explain the feeling. Just watch it.</p>
